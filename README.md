# Multi UART Interface
Sample source code for DIY PR27. Project description : This PIC16F877A microcontroller based project is designed as an introduction of UART communication. This project will teach you how to use the internal UART peripheral and write own UART communication protocol as well.

There is 3 folder which are Source code C and hex file, Sample code using MPLABX and sample code using MPLAB(Using MPLAB 8.6 And HiTech 9.80) Welcome to our tecnical forum for any inquiry.
